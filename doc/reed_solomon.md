## Reed Solomon

Reed Solomon codes are error-correcting codes that are used in many applications such as satellite communications, bar codes, CDROMS etc.

A Reed-Solomon (RS) Code is a cyclic error correction and detection code that uses symbol patterns instead of the standard bit patterns in order to transmit and receive messages. Each symbol is constituted of m different bits and the correlation between bits and symbolsis done using the theory of Finite Fields.

- Block codes take k symbols from the data stream and add n-k parity symbols.
- In linear codes, the codeword can be represented as a matrix multiplication.

## Galois Fields

A field is a set of elements on which the operations of additionand multiplicationare defined. The operations are commutative, associative, and closed. Closure impliles that thesum and product of any two elements in the field are also elements of the field.

A field also has additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1) such thata+ 0 =aand 1a=afor any element in the field. Elements of a field must have additive andmultiplicative inverses.

The Finite Fields or Galois Fields (GF) exists with m elements for any p a prime number.Given that a binary number is represented two possible different ways (either a logical 0 or 1) and also that p = 2 is a prime number then it is possible to find a finite field for a set a binary numbers.

## Convolutional code

Convolutional codes work on a continuous stream of input beats, as opposed to block of bits. Convolutional codes are described by three parameters n(output), k(input), m(size)
